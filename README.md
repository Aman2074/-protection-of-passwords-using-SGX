1-Generate an SGX Enclave: Create an enclave where the password handling functions will be executed securely.

2-Implement Password Handling Functions: Inside the enclave, implement functions to securely handle passwords, such as hashing and verifying passwords.

3-Encrypt Passwords: Encrypt passwords before storing them on disk using enclave-generated keys.

4-Secure Key Management: Use SGX to securely manage encryption keys within the enclave.

5-Integration with Application: Implement an application (outside the enclave) that interacts with the enclave for password handling operations.
